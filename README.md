 
 # NBCE 
 
 This is the source code of our NACL 2024's paper: Jianlin, Su, Murtadha, Ahmed, et al. "Naive Bayes-based Context Extension for Large Language Models". 
 NBCE enables existing LLMs to perform ICL with an increased number of demonstrations by significantly expanding their context size

# Evaluation
